1.  <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>
     <script>
     alert( "I’m JavaScript!");
     </script>

    </body>
    </html>

2.  <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>
     <script src="/script.js">

     </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    
    script.js
    alert("I'm invoked!")
    
Explain the below how it works:

1. First an alert box with I'm Javascript! is displayed. Then alert box with Hello message is displayed.
   In the third alert box Wor and ld is displayed in two different lines. In fourth alert box 6 is displayed.
   
Fix the below to alert Guvi geek:


1.  let admin=9, fname=10.5; 
    fname = "Guvi";
    lname = "geek"
    admin = fname+ " " + lname;
    alert( admin );

2. let fname=10.5; 
    fname = "Guvi";
    lname = "geek"
    let name = fname+" "+lname;
    alert( `hello ${name}` );
    
Fix the below to alert sum of two numbers:

1.  let a = prompt("First number?");
    let b = prompt("Second number?");
    alert(Number(a) + Number(b));
    

If you run the below scritpt you will get “Code is Blasted”

Explain Why the Code is blasted and how to diffuse it and get “Diffused":


1. Here two strings are being compared and hence 2 is compared with 1 and as 2>1, value of a is true and hence code is blasted.
   The value of a should be false to get Diffused.
    var a = "2" < "12";
    //Don't touch below this
    if (a) {
      console.log("Code is Blasted")
    }
    else
    {
      console.log("Diffused") 
    }
    
    
 How to get Success in following code?:
 
 1. If cancel is pressed in the prompt, success is displayed.
